    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "Abstract\nState restrictions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have become increasingly pervasive across the globe. While this crackdown has been shown to have a negative impact on public funding flows, we know little about how it impacts private philanthropy. How does information about crackdown abroad, as well as organizational attributes of nonprofits affect individual donors’ willingness to donate internationally? Using a survey experiment, we find that learning about repressive NGO environments increases generosity in that already-likely donors are willing to donate substantially more to legally besieged nonprofits. This generosity persists when mediated by two organizational-level heuristics: NGO issue areas and main funding sources. We discuss the implications of our results on how nonprofits can use different framing appeals to increase fundraising at a time when traditional public donor funding to such organizations is decreasing."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws provide little information in predicting future repression, their patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties."

    "text": "In the weeks since the January 25 revolution there have been dozens of explanations for Mubarak’s downfall. Political scientists, diplomats, economists, sociologists, and even international aid workers have proposed theories to explain the economic, political, historical, and social causes of the Egyptian revolution. Despite the plethora of interdisciplinary theories in the press and in academia, few—if any—have analyzed Mubarak’s resignation in the light of managerial dynamics and behavior.\nIn addition to a ripe political environment, horrible economic conditions, and a mobilized and angry population, Mubarak’s fall from power can be attributed to his failure as a public manager. This paper analyzes Mubarak’s managerial strategy throughout the course of his presidency by (1) reviewing the structure of the National Democratic Party (NDP) and Mubarak’s relationship with it; (2) analyzing the foundational principles and assumptions of his strategy‚ both as the leader of Egypt and as the chairman of the NDP; and (3) tracing the application of that strategy and determining its effectiveness in confronting “the management challenge” over a period of 30 years."

    "text": "Abstract\nA wave of legislative and regulatory crackdown on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) has constricted the legal environment for foreign advocacy groups interested in influencing domestic and global policy. Although the legal space for advocacy is shrinking, many INGOs have continued their work and found creative ways to adapt to these restrictions, sometimes even reshaping the regulatory environments of their target countries in their favor. In this article, I explore what enables INGOs to cope with and reshape their regulatory environments. I bridge international relations and interest group literatures to examine the interaction between INGO resource configurations and institutional arrangements. I argue that specific resource and managerial characteristics provide organizations with ‘programmatic flexibility’ that enables groups to adjust their strategies without changing their core mission. I illustrate and test this argument with case studies of Article 19 and AMERA International and demonstrate how organizations with high programmatic flexibility can navigate regulations and shape policy in their target country, while those without this flexibility are shut out of policy discussions and often the target country itself. I conclude by exploring how the interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments shape and constrain the effects of interest groups in global governance."

After developing an organizing framework that permits careful analysis of the internal, interactive, and institutional factors that influence policy outcomes, we demonstrate the merits of the framework by applying it to each book. We evaluate each work’s contributions to individual layers in the framework, locating each book within its intended scholarly context. We identify ties between books, examining how each work implicitly treats the other layers of our framework. The conclusion identifies a new research agenda for INGO studies and outlines promising avenues for future INGO scholarship."

This article presents the results of a global survey of nearly 500 anti-trafficking NGOs in working in 133 countries, and is the first NGO-focused survey of its kind. Based on the results of the survey, we provide an overview of the anti-trafficking NGO sector as a whole, detail the relationship between anti-trafficking NGOs and the US, and account for some of the variation in NGO opinions of US efforts. Notably, we find that NGOs are remarkably satisfied with US-led efforts—despite their acknowledged flaws—and that NGOs believe that American anti-TIP policies are important and, on balance, helpful. These results also provide a warning for the future of the United States’ anti-trafficking advocacy, suggesting that the US avoid politicizing its annual Trafficking in Persons Report."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcological theorists have generated several yet unresolved disputes that try to untangle the difficulty in understanding the nature of complex ecological communities. In this paper, we combine two recent theoretical approaches that used together suggest a promising way to consider how evolutionary and ecological processes may be used to frame a general theory of community ecology and its functional stability. First, we consider the theoretical proposal by Mark Vellend (2016) to focus on a small set of higher-level evolutionary and ecological processes that act on species within an ecological community. These processes provide a basis for ecological theory similar to the way in which theoretical population genetics has focused on a small set of mathematical descriptions to undergird its theory. Second, we explore ideas that might be applied to ecosystem functioning developed by Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio’s (2015) work on how biologically autonomous systems emerge from closure of relevant constraints. To explore the possibility that combining these two ideas may provide a more general theoretical understanding of ecological communities, we have developed a stochastic, agent-based model, with agents representing species, that explores the potential of using evolutionary and ecological processes as a constraint on the flow of species through an ecosystem. We explore how these ideas help illuminate aspects of stability found in many ecological communities. These agent-based modeling results provide in-principle arguments that suggest that constraint closure, using evolutionary and ecological processes, explains general features of ecological communities. In particular, we find that our model suggests a perspective useful in explaining repeated patterns of stability in ecological evenness, species turnover, species richness, and in measures of fitness."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaboration and its promotion by funders continue to accelerate. Although research has identified significant transaction costs associated with collaboration, little empirical work has examined the broader, societal-level economic outcomes of a resource-sharing environment. Does an environment that encourages collaboration shift our focus toward certain types of social objectives and away from others? This paper uses agent-based Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that collaboration is particularly useful when resources are rare but a social objective is commonly held. However, collaboration can lead to bad outcomes when the objective is not commonly shared; in such cases, markets outperform collaborative arrangements. These findings suggest that encouraging a resource-sharing environment can lead to inefficiencies even worse than market failure. We also demonstrate that failure to account for transaction costs when prescribing collaboration can result in quantifiably lower outcome levels than expected."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most repeated phrases in any introductory statistics class is the warning that “correlation is not causation.” This chapter presents new non-statistical language for creating, measuring, and evaluating causal stories and relationships using observational (i.e. non-experimental) data. It introduces the concept of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allow us to formally encode our understanding of causal stories. With well-crafted DAGs, one can use a set of rules called do-calculus to make specific adjustments to statistical models and isolate or identify causal relationships between variables of interest. Edges (or arrows) transmit associations between nodes. Following the fundamental problem of causal inference, answering causal questions without an experiment appears impossible. The chapter explores different methods of making adjustments using synthetic data. Instead of throwing away potentially useful data, one can use other methods to create matches that are less discrete and more informative."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Authoritarian restrictions on domestic and international civil society have increased over the past decade, but authoritarian states continue to allow—and even invite—NGOs to work in their countries. Though the services and advocacy provided by NGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of authoritarian regimes, the majority of autocratic states allow NGO activities, and NGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions and attempts to limit their activities. This chapter examines the theories about and the experiences of domestic and international NGOs working in authoritarian countries. The review is premised on the theory of authoritarian institutions: dictators delegate political authority to democratic-appearing institutions in order to remain in power and maintain stability. After providing a brief overview of authoritarian institutionalism and balancing, I discuss how domestic and international NGOs fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. I then look at three forms of state–NGO relationships in the context of authoritarianism and explore how autocrats have addressed and regulated international NGOs in particular. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments have imposed restrictions on movement, association, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. In many cases, such as New Zealand, these emergency measures have been temporary and respect for human rights has returned to normal. In many other instances, however, governments have used these restrictions to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. Systematically measuring the consequences of COVID restrictions, however, is a difficult task. We will examine two possible quantitative measures of the relationship between of COVID restrictions and civil society space. First, we will use the Variety of Democracy project’s newly released Pandemic Violations of Democratic Standards Index to explore if and how civil society restrictions predict pandemic backsliding. Second, while many countries sign international human rights treaties that ostensibly bind states to respect rights, several treaties allow for emergency derogations from these obligations. We will tabulate formal human rights treaty derogations due to the pandemic and explore whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights. We hope that our exploration of these two measures will provide rich data-based descriptions of the relationship between COVID restrictions and civic space that will allow for more causal work in the future."

    "text": "Abstract\nForeign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver foreign aid. However, states are increasingly relying on repressive legislation to crack down on NGOs within their borders. How have foreign aid donors responded to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues, and channeling more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs. While our findings challenge existing notions of foreign aid running on “autopilot,” they also have worrying implications for Western donors and domestic NGOs working on contentious issues."

    "title": "Taking Uncertainty Seriously: Bayesian Marginal Structural Models for Causal Inference in Political Science",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political science have developed largely within the frequentist framework (i.e., Blackwell and Glynn 2018; Imai and Kim 2019; Torres 2020). In this article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the estimation of causal effects (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020; Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). Extending the approach to causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under selection on observables introduced by Blackwell and Glynn (2018), we develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the context of parametric survival analysis and linear mixed effects models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed method."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe “causal revolution” in the broader social sciences has led to a new field of observational causal inference. However, these advancements have been less used among nonprofit scholars and practitioners. In this article, we provide a methodological guide for applying causal inference tools within nonprofit studies. We walk through practical examples of model-based and design-based approaches from epidemiology and econometrics to observational causal inference, including causal models, inverse probability weighting, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. We include empirical illustrations of these approaches by replicating existing nonprofit research and program evaluations. We conclude with a call for more careful and explicit attempts at making causal claims in nonprofit studies."

    "section": "Mutation",
    "text": "Mutation\nA mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism. Mutations can result from errors in DNA replication during cell division, exposure to mutagens or a viral infection.\nGermline mutations (that occur in eggs and sperm) can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations (that occur in body cells) are not passed on.\n\nThe translation of disrupted sequence can be checked via Expasy\n\nSubstitution\nSubstitution, as related to genomics, is a type of mutation in which one nucleotide is replaced by a different nucleotide. The term can also refer to the replacement of one amino acid in a protein with a different amino acid.\n\nc.123A>G: on cDNA, A in 123 is replaced by G\np.P252R: on protein, proline (P) replaced by arginine (R)\n\n\n\n\nPoint mutation\nA point mutation occurs in a genome when a single base pair is added, deleted or changed. While most point mutations are benign, they can also have various functional consequences, including changes in gene expression or alterations in encoded proteins.\nA point mutation is when a single base pair is altered. Point mutations can have one of three effects.\n\nFirst, the base substitution can be a silent mutation where the altered codon corresponds to the same amino acid.\nSecond, the base substitution can be a missense mutation where the altered codon corresponds to a different amino acid.\nOr third, the base substitution can be a nonsense mutation where the altered codon corresponds to a stop signal.\n\n\nA missense mutation is a DNA change that results in different amino acids being encoded at a particular position in the resulting protein. Some missense mutations alter the function of the resulting protein.\n\nA nonsense mutation occurs in DNA when a sequence change gives rise to a stop codon rather than a codon specifying an amino acid. The presence of the new stop codon results in the production of a shortened protein that is likely non-functional.\n\n\n\nDeletion\nDeletion, as related to genomics, is a type of mutation that involves the loss of one or more nucleotides from a segment of DNA. A deletion can involve the loss of any number of nucleotides, from a single nucleotide to an entire piece of a chromosome.\n\nc.546delT, deletion of T in 546\nc.586_591del, for six bases deleted\np.F508del, deletion of phenylalanine (F) in 508\n\n\n\n\nDuplication\nDuplication, as related to genomics, refers to a type of mutation in which one or more copies of a DNA segment (which can be as small as a few bases or as large as a major chromosomal region) is produced. Duplications occur in all organisms. For example, they are especially prominent in plants, although they can also cause genetic diseases in humans. Duplications have been an important mechanism in the evolution of the genomes of humans and other organisms.\n\nc.546dupT, duplication of T in 546\nc.586_591dup, duplication of the segment 586 to 591\np.G4_Q6dup, duplication of the segment from glycine (G) in 4 to glutamine (Q) in 6\n\n\n\n\nInsertion\nAn insertion, as related to genomics, is a type of mutation that involves the addition of one or more nucleotides into a segment of DNA. An insertion can involve the addition of any number of nucleotides, from a single nucleotide to an entire piece of a chromosome.\n\nc.546_547insT, insertion of T between 546 and 547\nc.1086_1087insGCGTGA, insertion of GCGTGA\np.K2_L3insQS, insertion of glutamine serine between lysine (K) in 2 and leucine (L) in 3\n\n\n\n\nInversion\nAn inversion in a chromosome occurs when a segment breaks off and reattaches within the same chromosome, but in reverse orientation. DNA may or may not be lost in the process.\n\nc.546_2031inv, segment 546 to 2031 inverted\n\n\n\n\nFrameshift\nA frameshift mutation in a gene refers to the insertion or deletion of nucleotide bases in numbers that are not multiples of three. This is important because a cell reads a gene’s code in groups of three bases when making a protein. Each of these “triplet codons” corresponds to one of 20 different amino acids used to build a protein. If a mutation disrupts this normal reading frame, then the entire gene sequence following the mutation will be incorrectly read. This can result in the addition of the wrong amino acids to the protein and/or the creation of a codon that stops the protein from growing longer.\n\np.R83SfsX15, arginine (R) is the first amino acid changed, it is in position 83, it makes serine (S) instead, the length of the shift frame is 15, including the stop codon (X)"
