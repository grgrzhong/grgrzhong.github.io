## Motivation

- Imaging-based phenotypic profiling enables systematic quantification of complex cellular phenotypes and tissue organizations under different treatment and disease conditions.

- Compare the morphology of cells from patients with and without disease, if we can find a difference in their profiles,  this can serve as a diagnostic tool.
- Even better, we can test thousands of drugs to find any that are able to reverse the disease profile and make cells looks healthy again.

## Typical Analysis workflow

- Step1: Image analysis
- Step2: Image quality control
- Step3: Preprocessing extracted features
- Step4: Dimensionality reduction
- Step5: Single-cell data aggregation
- Step6: Measuring profile similarity
- Step7: Assay quality assessment
- Step8: Downstream analysis
