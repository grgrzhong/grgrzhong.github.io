## Bulk RNA-seq

- Cheaper
- Simpler
- Statistically stronger with replicates

Suitable for:
✔️ Homogeneous samples (like cell lines)
✔️ High-throughput designs with many conditions
✔️ Studies where replication is key (e.g., drug treatments, time-course)
✔️ Situations where per-cell resolution won’t change your biological conclusion

## Single-Cell RNA-seq
Use scRNA-seq if your question depends on:

- Detecting rare populations
- Disentangling heterogeneous tissues
- Discovering cell-type-specific signals

In these cases, resolution matters—and scRNA-seq earns its price tag.

But know this: you’re trading off simplicity, QC, and replicability.
