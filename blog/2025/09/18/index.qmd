## Why environments are still painful
Re-running an analysis six months later can feel like archaeology: missing system libraries, different BLAST versions, broken Bioconductor installs, Python 3.X drift, orphaned `conda` envs, or an HPC node with older glibc. Traditional solutions (system modules, ad‑hoc conda envs, manual `pip install`) reduce friction short-term but leak entropy over time.

Containers give you:
- Immutability (image digest = frozen state)
- Portable stacks across laptop → cloud → HPC (with Singularity/Apptainer)
- Clear provenance (Dockerfile / definition recipe)
- Smaller cognitive diff when you onboard collaborators

They do NOT automatically guarantee:
- Determinism (if you use `apt-get install foo` without pinning)
- Security (you still pull unverified images?)
- Performance (I/O heavy workloads can still bottleneck)
- Zero maintenance (base images deprecate; CVEs accumulate)

::: callout-note
Containers encapsulate user space, not the kernel. Reproducibility ≠ identical hardware, kernel, or scheduler context.

## Quick landscape: environment strategies
| Strategy | Pros | Cons | Typical Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| System modules | Native performance, curated by HPC admins | Diverges across clusters; hidden dependency webs | Classical HPC pipelines |
| Conda / Mamba | Flexible, multi-language, no root | Dependency solver complexity, less immutable | Exploratory dev, local prototyping |
| Docker | Rich ecosystem, caching, OCI standard | Root daemon (on many systems), sometimes banned on HPC | Cloud + local builds |
| Singularity / Apptainer | Unprivileged run, HPC friendly | Single-file image (no layer reuse at runtime) | Production on clusters |
| Nix/Guix | Strong reproducibility, pure builds | Steeper learning curve | Long-term archival |
| Native packaging (deb/rpm) | Stable, audited | System-wide only (needs root) | Base layers in container builds |

## Core concepts (mental model)
| Term | Meaning | Analogy |
|------|---------|---------|
| Image | Read-only layered filesystem snapshot + config | Recipe output / frozen cake |
| Container | Running process + isolated view of the image + overlay | A plated slice being served |
| Layer | One diff in the filesystem graph | Git commit |
| Registry | Distribution endpoint for images | Package repository |
| Digest (sha256) | Content address (immutable) | Commit hash |
| Tag | Mutable reference pointer | Branch name |

### How layering works
Each `RUN`, `COPY`, or `ADD` typically adds a new layer. Efficient Dockerfiles:
- Order stable (rarely changing) layers first (base OS, core tools)
- Group commands that change together to reduce rebuild churn
- Avoid installing & removing large sets in the same layer without cleanup

## Choosing Docker vs Singularity/Apptainer
| Question | Docker Good? | Apptainer Good? | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Need to build locally with caching? | ✅ | ➖ (build via recipe, no layered runtime cache) | Use Docker for iterative builds |
| Running on multi-user HPC without root? | ❌ (often blocked) | ✅ | Apptainer safest choice |
| Need GPU (CUDA) support? | ✅ (with nvidia-container toolkit) | ✅ (passes through host drivers) | Versions must match host |
| Want smallest compressed artifact? | ✅ (with multi-stage) | ✅ (squashed SIF) | Different mechanisms |
| Need fine-grained image signing/policy? | ✅ (cosign, Notation) | ✅ (SIF signatures) | Supply chain matters |

## Minimal examples
### Simple Dockerfile (micromamba-based RNA-seq tooling)
```Dockerfile
FROM mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.9

# Create env with pinned versions
USER root
RUN micromamba install -y -n base -c bioconda -c conda-forge \
    fastqc=0.12.1 multiqc=1.15 hisat2=2.2.1 samtools=1.20 subread=2.0.6 \
    python=3.11 && \
    micromamba clean -a -y

# Add a non-root user (safer default)
RUN useradd -m analyst
USER analyst
WORKDIR /workspace

ENTRYPOINT ["bash"]
```

Build & run (locally):
```bash
docker build -t rnaseq:1.0 .
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace rnaseq:1.0 fastqc --help
```

### Equivalent Singularity/Apptainer definition
```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.9

%post
    micromamba install -y -n base -c bioconda -c conda-forge \
        fastqc=0.12.1 multiqc=1.15 hisat2=2.2.1 samtools=1.20 subread=2.0.6 python=3.11
    micromamba clean -a -y
    useradd -m analyst || true

%environment
    export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH

%runscript
    exec "$@"
```
Build on HPC login node (no root required if fuse/suid setup):
```bash
apptainer build rnaseq.sif rnaseq.def
apptainer run rnaseq.sif fastqc --version
```

::: callout-tip
If your cluster forbids remote pulls, pre-build the image elsewhere and transfer the `.sif` file (checksummed).

## Common pitfalls & fixes
| Pitfall | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Bloated image (8–10 GB) | Large conda env; unused build caches | Use micromamba, pin only required tools, remove caches |
| Inconsistent results | Unpinned OS packages (`apt-get update`) | Freeze apt sources or install exact versions; record manifest |
| Time-consuming rebuilds | Layers invalidated early | Put volatile steps (copy source) later |
| Fails on HPC | Docker daemon blocked | Convert via Apptainer or build Apptainer def directly |
| Hidden network dependency | Conda solving at runtime | Pre-solve at build time, avoid env creation inside workflow step |

## Layer ordering strategy (example)
```Dockerfile
# 1. Base image (rarely changes)
FROM ubuntu:24.04 AS base
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 2. Toolchain layer
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential wget bzip2 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 3. Micromamba + bio tools
# (Changes if you alter version pins)
# ...

# 4. Pipeline scripts (volatile)
COPY workflow/ /opt/workflow/
```
Goal: Stable early layers cache across small workflow edits.

## Reproducible build practices
1. Pin everything (base image digest, package versions, channels ordering)
2. Capture a manifest: write `conda list --explicit > env.lock` during build
3. Prefer micromamba (faster solver, smaller footprint)
4. No `apt-get upgrade` — install specific packages only
5. Use multi-stage builds to compile large tools then copy binaries into a slim runtime
6. Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) (`syft packages dir:` or `tern`)
7. Sign images (`cosign sign --key cosign.key image@sha256:...`)

## Example: multi-stage to shrink Bioconductor image
```Dockerfile
FROM bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_19 AS build
RUN R -q -e 'install.packages(c("BiocManager")); BiocManager::install(c("DESeq2"), ask=FALSE)'

FROM rocker/r2u:jammy
# Copy only needed libs from previous stage
COPY --from=build /usr/local/lib/R /usr/local/lib/R
COPY --from=build /usr/local/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R
ENTRYPOINT ["R"]
```

## Integrating with workflow engines
### Snakemake
```python
rule fastqc:
    input: "data/{sample}.fq.gz"
    output: "qc/{sample}_fastqc.html"
    container: "docker://rnaseq:1.0"  # or "apptainer://rnaseq.sif"
    threads: 2
    shell: "fastqc {input} -o qc"
```

### Nextflow
```groovy
process FASTQC {
  container 'rnaseq:1.0'
  input:
    path reads
  output:
    path "qc"
  script:
  """
  fastqc $reads -o qc
  """
}
```

### Rmarkdown / Quarto
Use a named project execution environment or call external container via `processx` + `docker run` if necessary for isolation.

## HPC binding patterns (Apptainer)
```bash
apptainer exec \
  --bind /scratch:/scratch,/project/genomes:/ref \
  rnaseq.sif \
  hisat2 -x /ref/hg38 -U sample.fq.gz -S sample.sam
```
Common mounts: `/scratch`, large shared reference directories, license servers, GPU drivers (`/usr/lib64/nvidia` auto-detected).

::: callout-important
Never embed large static reference genomes inside the image unless they are versioned and universally reused—prefer mounted read-only references to reduce duplication.
:::

## Security & provenance quick wins
| Practice | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Scan for CVEs | `trivy image rnaseq:1.0` |
| Generate SBOM | `syft rnaseq:1.0 -o json > sbom.json` |
| Sign image | `cosign sign` |
| Verify digest in workflow | Use `image@sha256:...` |
| Least privilege | Non-root user; minimal packages |

## When NOT to containerize
- Ultra-fast iteration on a one-off exploratory script (use conda + micro env)
- Tight coupling to HPC vendor-tuned MPI stack (use system modules)
- Extremely large monolithic datasets (prefer external mounts)

## Quick cheatsheet
```bash
# Build docker image
docker build -t toolset:0.1 .
# Export to singularity (method 1)
apptainer build toolset.sif docker-daemon://toolset:0.1
# Or pull directly (method 2)
apptainer pull docker://yourrepo/toolset:0.1
# Run command
apptainer exec toolset.sif samtools --version
```

## Minimal version manifest pattern
```bash
cat <<EOF > VERSIONS.txt
fastqc $(fastqc --version 2>&1 | awk '{print $2}')
$(samtools --version | head -1)
$(hisat2 --version | head -1)
EOF
```
Commit that with pipeline outputs for provenance.

## Future directions
- Reproducible builds with `--provenance` attestations (increasing adoption)
- Hybrid: Nix builds exported to OCI images
- Content trust pipelines (Rekor transparency logs + SBOM diffing)
- WASM-based bioinformatics modules for partially sandboxed execution

## Summary
Containers provide a portable, inspectable, and (mostly) reproducible substrate for bioinformatics workflows—especially across heterogeneous compute environments. Effective practice centers on pinning, layering discipline, security hygiene, and clean integration with workflow managers.

::: callout-tip
Start small: containerize one stable tool chain (QC + alignment) before wrapping your entire multi-omics pipeline.
