R and ggplot can create fantastic graphs, but the default Arial/Helvetica font is too boring and standard. You can change the font used in a plot fairly easily three different ways:

1. All of the built-in ggplot themes have a `base_family` argument for setting the overall font family for the plot
2. `element_text()` has a `family` argument for changing fonts on individual plot elements
3. `geom_text()` and `annotate(geom = "text", ...)` have a `family` argument for changing fonts on text layers

```{r}
# Save the plot as a PDF with ggsave and Cairo
# R will want to autocomplete cairo_pdf to cairo_pdf() (note the parentheses)
# This will not work with the parentheses; ensure there aren't any
ggsave(p, filename = "example.pdf", device = cairo_pdf,
       width = 4, height = 3, units = "in")

# You can also save the plot as a high resolution PNG using 
# AGG or Cairo
# With {ragg}
ggsave(p, filename = "whatever.png",
       device = ragg::agg_png, res = 300,
       width = 4, height = 3, units = "in")

# With Cairo
ggsave(p, filename = "whatever.png",
       device = png, type = "cairo", dpi = 300,
       width = 4, height = 3, units = "in")
```
