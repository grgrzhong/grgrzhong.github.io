My research interests focus on the genetic determinants underlying disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. Particaulary, I am interested in:

## Education
2014 - 2019 Ph.D., Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, South China University of Technology,
Guangzhou, China.

2010 - 2014 B.S. Biotechnology, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China.

## Experience
2025 – Present Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Pathology, LKS Faculty of Medicine,
The University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong SAR, China.

2019 – 2024 Scientist / Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Agency for
Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.

## Research Interests
* Genome edition technologies (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) to dissect gene functions in cancer and immune cells.
* High-throughput imaging and computational analysis to study cell behaviors.
* Single-cell omics to study cellular heterogeneity and dynamics.
* Develop and use quantitative in vitro/image assays and machine learning models to predict the biological effects of genetic mutations, drugs and/or environmental agents.
