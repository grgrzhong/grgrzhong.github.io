<!-- Hi! This is Guorui. I'am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong.  -->

My research interests focus on the genetic determinants underlying disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. Particaulary, I am interested in:

    - Genome edition technologies (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) to dissect gene functions in cancer and immune cells.
    - High-throughput imaging and computational analysis to study cell behaviors.
    - Single-cell omics to study cellular heterogeneity and dynamics.
    - Develop and use quantitative in vitro/image assays and machine learning models to predict the biological effects of genetic mutations, drugs and/or environmental agents.
