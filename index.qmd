👋 Hi, I am Guorui Zhong.

🔬 Cell biologist with applied skills in bioinformatics and computational biology.
🧪 Wet‑lab expertise in developing genome-editing cell models with CRISPR/Cas9.
📊 Experienced in analyzing Multi-Omics dataset, including WGS, WES, RNA‑seq, scRNA-seq, methylation arrays, and proteomics datasets.
📊 Experienced in imaging-based phenotypic profiling with machine learning application.
💻 Skilled in R (tidyverse, Bioconductor, ggplot2) and expanding my Python toolkit.
<!-- 🎓 Certified in Data Analysis for Genomics (HarvardX). -->
🌱 Actively exploring public datasets (TCGA, PDC) and sharing reproducible analyses here on GitHub.

## Education
2014 - 2019 Ph.D., Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, South China University of Technology,
Guangzhou, China.

2010 - 2014 B.S. Biotechnology, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China.

## Experience
2025 – Present Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Pathology, LKS Faculty of Medicine,
The University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong SAR, China.

2019 – 2024 Scientist / Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Agency for
Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.

## Research Interests
* Genome edition technologies (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) to dissect gene functions in cancer and immune cells.
* High-throughput imaging and computational analysis to study cell behaviors.
* Single-cell omics to study cellular heterogeneity and dynamics.
* Develop and use quantitative in vitro/image assays and machine learning models to predict the biological effects of genetic mutations, drugs and/or environmental agents.
