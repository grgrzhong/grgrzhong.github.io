<!-- Hi! This is Guorui. I'am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. 

My research interests focus on the interface of cancer biology and immunogenomics, with an emphasis on understanding the genetic determinants underlying disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. I am particularly interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving these processes to inform the development of innovative therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, gene therapy, and cell-based interventions. 

My work integrates advanced methodologies such as single-cell omics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene manipulation, and high-throughput imaging to generate novel insights into disease biology and contribute to the advancement of precision medicine and drug discovery. -->
