👋 Hi, This is Guorui Zhong. Something about my stuff:

- Cell biologist with applied skills in bioinformatics and computational biology.

- Wet‑lab expertise in developing genome-editing cell models with CRISPR/Cas9.

- Experienced in analyzing Multi-Omics dataset, including WGS, WES, RNA‑seq, scRNA-seq, methylation arrays, and proteomics datasets.

- Experienced in imaging-based phenotypic profiling with machine learning application.

- Skilled in R (tidyverse, Bioconductor, ggplot2) and expanding my Python toolkit.


## Research Interests


* Genome edition technologies (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) to dissect gene functions in cancer and immune cells.

* High-throughput imaging and computational analysis to study cell behaviors.

* Single-cell omics to study cellular heterogeneity and dynamics.

* Develop and use quantitative in vitro/image assays and machine learning models to predict the biological effects of genetic mutations, drugs and/or environmental agents.
